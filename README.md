A website that will allow researchers and scientists to stay in sync with their lab and the scientific community.

Python, Django, PostgreSQL

First iteration: Users will be able to create an account and once logged in, can connect their email and calendar, see all fellow lab members and send direct messages and post in a real-time chat app.

Future plans:
* Upload and process data files
* Build out network to connect labs with other labs in the scientific community.
